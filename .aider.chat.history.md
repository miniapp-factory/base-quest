Build a Gamified Social Quest Miniapp on Base Mainnet

Objective:
Create a miniapp on Base mainnet called “Base Quest” that boosts user interaction with the network by offering daily/weekly onchain challenges. Each action should cost users a small transaction fee (around $0.1 in ETH), making participation accessible and fun.

Core Features:

Quest System:

Users receive daily or weekly onchain quests (e.g., send a micro-tip, mint a badge NFT, vote on a poll, join a group).
Completing quests earns users XP, unique NFT badges, or small token rewards.
Social Layer:

Users can challenge friends or random users to complete quests.
Leaderboards display the most active participants.
NFT Badges:

Each completed quest allows users to mint a unique, date-stamped NFT badge.
Badges are displayed in user profiles and can be traded.
Low Transaction Fees:

All actions are designed to cost ~$0.1 in ETH or less, leveraging Base’s low fees.
Optionally, integrate account abstraction so users can pay gas with stablecoins or PROMPT.
Network Engagement:

Every quest requires an onchain transaction, increasing Base network activity.
Encourage users to explore DeFi, NFTs, and social features on Base.
User Flow Example:

User logs in and sees today’s quests.
Completes a quest (e.g., mints a badge NFT for $0.1 in ETH).
Earns XP and a badge, climbs the leaderboard.
Challenges a friend to complete the same quest.
Returns tomorrow for new quests and rewards.
Technical Requirements:

Deploy on Base mainnet.
Smart contracts for quest logic and NFT badge minting.
Frontend for quest display, badge gallery, and leaderboards.
Micro-transaction support (~$0.1 in ETH per action).
Optional: Account abstraction for flexible gas payments.
Stretch Goals:

Integrate with other Base dApps for cross-promotion.
Add social sharing features.
Enable badge trading or marketplace.
Deliverables:

Smart contract code (Solidity, verified on Base mainnet).
Frontend miniapp (React or similar).
Documentation for users and developers.

The files that will need to be edited or added to satisfy the request are:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create or update this file to describe the new app logo.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Please add the file `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` to the chat so I can create the logo description. Once that file is added, I will provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to update `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`.

#### apply changes  

I need the two files that will be edited:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the `title` and `description`.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to create the logo description.

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized blue and gold shield with a bold 'B' in the center, representing Base Quest. The shield has a subtle gradient from deep blue at the top to a lighter blue at the bottom, and a small gold star sits at the top right corner to symbolize achievement and progress. The background is a clean white, making the logo stand out on any surface.
