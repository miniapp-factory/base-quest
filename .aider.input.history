+Code the following app
+```
+Build a Gamified Social Quest Miniapp on Base Mainnet
+
+Objective:
+Create a miniapp on Base mainnet called “Base Quest” that boosts user interaction with the network by offering daily/weekly onchain challenges. Each action should cost users a small transaction fee (around $0.1 in ETH), making participation accessible and fun.
+
+Core Features:
+
+Quest System:
+
+Users receive daily or weekly onchain quests (e.g., send a micro-tip, mint a badge NFT, vote on a poll, join a group).
+Completing quests earns users XP, unique NFT badges, or small token rewards.
+Social Layer:
+
+Users can challenge friends or random users to complete quests.
+Leaderboards display the most active participants.
+NFT Badges:
+
+Each completed quest allows users to mint a unique, date-stamped NFT badge.
+Badges are displayed in user profiles and can be traded.
+Low Transaction Fees:
+
+All actions are designed to cost ~$0.1 in ETH or less, leveraging Base’s low fees.
+Optionally, integrate account abstraction so users can pay gas with stablecoins or PROMPT.
+Network Engagement:
+
+Every quest requires an onchain transaction, increasing Base network activity.
+Encourage users to explore DeFi, NFTs, and social features on Base.
+User Flow Example:
+
+User logs in and sees today’s quests.
+Completes a quest (e.g., mints a badge NFT for $0.1 in ETH).
+Earns XP and a badge, climbs the leaderboard.
+Challenges a friend to complete the same quest.
+Returns tomorrow for new quests and rewards.
+Technical Requirements:
+
+Deploy on Base mainnet.
+Smart contracts for quest logic and NFT badge minting.
+Frontend for quest display, badge gallery, and leaderboards.
+Micro-transaction support (~$0.1 in ETH per action).
+Optional: Account abstraction for flexible gas payments.
+Stretch Goals:
+
+Integrate with other Base dApps for cross-promotion.
+Add social sharing features.
+Enable badge trading or marketplace.
+Deliverables:
+
+Smart contract code (Solidity, verified on Base mainnet).
+Frontend miniapp (React or similar).
+Documentation for users and developers.

+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
